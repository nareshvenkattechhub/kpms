                Taxation forms the core of governance. The last ten years of the BJP/ NDA government is a case of "taxation gone berserk". The share of taxes paid by the common person and the poor through regressive indirect taxes has increased significantly and the share of taxes paid by corporate has decreased-the exact opposite of what a people-friendly and progressive taxation policy should be. Despite the tall claims of increasing the tax base through demonetization and GST, India's overall tax to GDP has not increased in the last decade, leaving very little room for increased expenditure. Congress will undertake a complete overhaul of India's taxation system to make it people-friendly and efficient, and to incentivize private savings and investment.

                The two realities that India faces are (1) that nearly 60 per cent of the people live in rural areas and (2) urbanization is taking place rapidly. Hence, we have to pay equal attention to rural development and urban development, and provide adequate infrastructure in our villages and towns/ cities. INDUSTRY THRE In order to become a developed economy and create good quality jobs for hundreds of thousands of youth, it is critical that India transitions from a consumer economy to a producer economy. India must become a manufacturing powerhouse that produces goods and services for itself and the world. To this end, beyond economic and business factors, the most vital ingredient is social harmony that will attract investments and a skilled labour force. It is thus no surprise that in the last 25 years, India's manufacturing share of GDP has been higher during the Congress rule. On the contrary, in the last 10 years (2014-24), the share of manufacturing has stagnated at 14 per cent.

From scheduling World Cup games in select venues for overt political to turning a blind eye to harassment purposes of India's Olympians by politically-aligned persons in sports bodies, Indian sports is arguably going through its worst phase. Congress believes that Indian sport will soar only when the autonomy of sports bodies is restored, political bias is removed, and the government is a strong and neutral supporting force for sports development.
